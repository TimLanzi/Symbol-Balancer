# Symbol Balancer
Parses a file for pairs of (), [], and {}. If there is a mismatched pair or a missing brace, the error will be reported. If there is no error, the program will report that all symbols are balanced. To run the program, you must pass the path of the file you wish to test as a command line argument. Otherwise, the program will report this error.
